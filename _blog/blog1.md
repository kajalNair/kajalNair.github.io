## Traditional way of doing it?
Traditionally, IT people would put servers in place and configure them manually. Now suppose you want to deploy an application, you would spin up a VM and configure it to correct settings required by the OS and application. You would install softwares and packages needed to get your application up and running. Now imagine that you want to run few more instances and to do all that manually, is gonna take hell lot of time. As the scale of infrastructure continues to expand, it is imperative to change the way infrastructure is designed, developed, configured, managed, and maintained. This is where Infrastructure as Code comes into play.

So the real idea behind infrastructure as code is: How do we take this whole process in some sense and capture that in a codified way? So if you need to do it as many times as you want, you can automate that. Every morning, you can hit a script that brings up a thousand machines, and every evening, hit the same script to bring it back down to required size.



## Infrastructure as Code
> According to Wikipedia, Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

##
Simply put, it lets you manage your infrastructure by just using configuration files. 
But how does IaC streamline all these processes?
