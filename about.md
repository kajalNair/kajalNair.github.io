> Hello, World! I am Kajal and I like to examine code, get it fixed and build tools for doing same.

## Humble Beginnings

I grew up in a town in Punjab and did my schooling from Jalandhar. I started off my interest with HTML/CSS back in college. Ever since I have been trying to learn and explore
various technologies.

## College

I did my graduation from Chandigarh University, Punjab. 

## Work

I am working as a Security Consultant at Synopsys since 2018. 

I like to contribute to open source security in general. It's one of the best
ways to learn something and be a part of awesome security community. I spent a lot of my time in research and trying out something-new.

I mostly code in Java, Python and some JavaScript. I like to try out new
languages. Apart from the aforementioned languages,
I know a little bit of C, C# too.

Recently, I cleared OSWE in December 2020.

## Personal Interests

I also started learning to cook. My favourite TV shows are Suits, Gotham and 3.
