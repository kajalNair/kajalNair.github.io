> Hello, World! I am Kajal and I like to examine code, get it fixed and build tools for doing same.

## Humble Beginnings

I grew up in a town in Punjab and did my schooling from Jalandhar. I started off my interest with HTML/CSS back in college. Ever since I have been trying to learn and explore various technologies.

## College

I did my graduation from Chandigarh University, Punjab. 

## Work

I am working as a Security Engineer at CRED. Before joining CRED, I was working as a Security Consultant within Software Integrity Group at Synopsys. 

I mostly code in Java, Python and some JavaScript. I like to try out new languages. Apart from the aforementioned languages, I know a little bit of C, PHP too.

I like to go through thousands and sometimes millions of lines of code to find the flaw at source code level. I mostly spend my time on research and finding new ways to break into softwares, identify weaknesses and find solutions to remediate them at code and/or configuration levels. I am actively contributing to open source security by participating on platfroms like huntr and HackerOne.

My interest in different programming languages made me sign up for OSWE exam, and after 3 months non-stop prep and swinging for 48 hours in proctored exam, I obtained my Offensive Security Web Expert certification back in 2020. 


## Personal Interests

Anything that causes adrenaline rush, excites me! 0_o
